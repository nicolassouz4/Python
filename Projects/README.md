  <p>This repository showcases projects that I developed while learning Python.</p><br>
  
  <h2><a href='https://github.com/nicolassouz4/Python/blob/793b31bfa87d9432911ffac28f83ef812f3930a5/Projects/01%20-%20TIC%20TAC%20TOE.ipynb'> 01 - Tic Tac Toe<a></h2>
  <p>The objective of this project was to create a simple implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Python. The project followed these main steps:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>&#127942; Class Creation:</strong> The game logic is encapsulated in a TicTacToe class, which helps organize the code and separate it from other parts of the program.</li>
    <li><strong>&#128260; Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> The use of classes and objects allows for a more organized and modular approach to designing the game, making it easier to manage and extend.</li>
    <li><strong>&#128202; Data Structures:</strong> Lists are used to represent the game board, with each element corresponding to a cell in the grid, allowing for easy access and manipulation of the game state.</li>
    <li><strong>&#127919; Functions:</strong> Functions are used to encapsulate specific actions, such as checking for a winner, updating the game board, and handling player input, making the code more readable and maintainable.</li>
    <li><strong>&#128260; Loops:</strong> The main game loop controls the flow of the game, allowing players to take turns until a winner is determined or the game ends in a draw.</li>
    <li><strong>&#9876; Conditional Statements:</strong> Conditional statements are used to check for win conditions, such as three in a row, column, or diagonal, determining the outcome of the game.</li>
    <li><strong>&#128433; User Input Handling:</strong> The program uses user input to allow players to choose their markers (X or O) and make moves on the game board, enhancing interactivity and player engagement.</li>
    <li><strong>&#9888; Error Handling:</strong> The program includes error handling to validate user input, ensuring that players enter valid moves and preventing crashes or unexpected behavior.</li>
    <li><strong>&#128257; Code Reusability:</strong> By using classes and functions, the code is more reusable, allowing for easier maintenance and extension of the game in the future.</li>
  </ul>

  <p> This project aimed to create a Blackjack game in Python. The project followed these main steps:</p>
  <ul>
        <li><strong>&#127942; Classes:</strong> The project uses classes to represent various components of the game, such as Card, Deck, Hand, and Chips. This allows for a more organized and modular code structure.</li>
        <li><strong>&#127919; Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):</strong> OOP principles are employed to encapsulate the game's logic and data within classes. This improves code reusability and maintainability.</li>
        <li><strong>&#9876; Conditional Statements:</strong> Conditional statements are used to implement game rules, such as determining if a player's hand exceeds 21 (busts) or if the dealer should hit or stand based on their hand value.</li>
        <li><strong>&#128260; Loops:</strong> Loops are utilized to control the flow of the game, such as the main game loop that continues until the player decides to stop playing.</li>
        <li><strong>&#128257; Functions:</strong> Functions are used to perform specific actions within the game, such as shuffling the deck, dealing cards, calculating hand values, and determining the winner.</li>
        <li><strong>&#127919; Data Structures:</strong> The project employs data structures like lists and dictionaries to represent the deck of cards, player hands, and card values. This allows for efficient data manipulation and storage.</li>
        <li><strong>&#128260; Error Handling:</strong> Error handling is implemented to validate user input, such as ensuring that the player's bet does not exceed their available chips.</li>
  </ul>
