    "1. try\n",
    "\n",
    "    * A try block is used to wrap the code that might raise an exception. If an exception occurs within this block, the subsequent except blocks are checked to see if they can handle the exception.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. except \n",
    "\n",
    "    * An except block is used to handle the exception that occurs in the try block. You can have multiple except blocks to handle different types of exceptions differently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. else \n",
    "\n",
    "    * An else block is optional and runs only if the try block did not raise an exception. It's useful for code that should run only if no exceptions were raised.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. finally \n",
    "\n",
    "    * A finally block is also optional and runs whether an exception occurred or not. It is typically used for cleanup actions, like closing files or releasing resources."
